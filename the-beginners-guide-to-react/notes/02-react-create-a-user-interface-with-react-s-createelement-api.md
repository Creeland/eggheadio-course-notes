## Notes

<TimeStamp start={28} end={31}>
  
Add these scripts to get React on to the page. 
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.12.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.12.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
```  
  
</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start={32} end={40}>
  
  Instead of creating DOM elements, weâ€™ll create React elements and then hand those off to `react-dom` to handle turning those into DOM elements and putting them into the page.
  
</TimeStamp>

If youâ€™ve ever learned or used React before, youâ€™re probably more familiar with JSX than Reactâ€™s `createElement` API, but itâ€™s important to understand the `createElement` API first so you understand the magic.

`React.createElement` API is as simple as the element that you want to create. Here we have a `<div>`, and then an object that has all of the props that you want to have applied, `className`, `children`.

Just as a convenience, in `React.createElement` all arguments after the props object are considered children.
